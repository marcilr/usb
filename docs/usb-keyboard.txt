Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 (HHKB Lite 2) USB keyboard.
Now up and operational. Does not work off of the D-Link 
DU-D520 USB card. Not sure whats up with that.

The keyboard works just fine off the Supermicro 370DE6 
USB port on the back of the workstation. Left BIOS
PCIPnP | Legacy USB Support set to "AUTO".

FIXME: Holding down the Delete key, to get to the bios
on boot, does not work from the USB keyboard. Likely a
370DE6 motherboard issue. i.e. Need to keep a PS/2 
motherboard around. Likely need a new motherboard at 
some point.

Turned keyboard DIP switch 3 on to turn Delete key into
BS (backspace) key. Still backspace key whether Fn key
is help down or not.


In Linux 2.6.19.1 make menuconfig:

Device Drivers -->
  USB Support -->
    <*> Support for Host-side USB
    [*]   USB device filesystem
    [*]   EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support
    <*> USB Mass Storage support
    [*]   SanDisk SDDR-09 (and other SmartMedia support (EXPERIMENTAL)
    <*> USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support
    [*]   HID input layer support
    [*] USB Monitor


Keyboard Configuration
======================
"You may not need any operating system support at all to use a USB keyboard 
if you have a PC architecture. There are several BIOS available where the 
BIOS can provide USB support from a keyboard plugged into the root hub on 
the motherboard. This may or may not work through other hubs and does not 
normally work with add-in boards, so you might want to add in support 
anyway. You definately want to add keyboard support if you add any 
operating system support, as the Linux USB support will disable the BIOS 
support. You also need to use Linux USB keyboard support if you want to 
use any of the "multimedia" types keys that are provided with some USB 
keybords.

In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on USB Human 
Interface Device (HID) support in USB support and Keyboard support in 
Input core support. Do not turn on USB HIDBP Keyboard support. Perform
 the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are installing 
as modules, you need to load the hid.o, input.o and keybdev.o modules.

Check the kernel logs to ensure that your keyboard is being correctly
 sensed by the kernel.

At this point, you should be able to use your USB keyboard as a normal 
keyboard. Be aware that LILO is not USB aware, and that unless your BIOS 
supports a USB keyboard, you may not be able to select a non-default boot 
image using the USB keyboard. I have personally used only a USB keyboard 
(and USB mouse) and have experienced no problems."

You have to select HID input support if you have a USB keyboard,
mouse, joystick or any other USB input device)
--- USB Input Devices

It looks like linux 2.4 had Input core support.  Think it is lacking
from linux 2.6.x kernels.

Code Listing 2.4: make menuconfig options for 2.4 kernels
(This immediate config is only for those who have USB input devices.
Input core support is needed by USB HID later.)
