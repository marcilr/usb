Working on getting USB mouse support up and
operational. Note from the linux-usb.org 
site.

Turn on USB Human Interface Device (HID)
support in the USB support and Mouse Support
in the Input core support.

In Linux 2.6.14 make menuconfig:

Device Drivers -->
  USB Support -->
    USB Human Interface Device (HID) support

/etc/X11/XF86Config:
===================

If you are using XFree86 version 4.0 or later,
add a InputDevice section that looks like the
following:

Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier  "USB Mice"
     Driver      "mouse"
     Option      "Protocol"   "IMPS/2"
     Option      "Device"     "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection

or, if you want to use a wheel mouse, something like:

Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier  "USB Mice"
     Driver      "mouse"
     Option      "Protocol"   "IMPS/2"
     Option      "Device"     "/dev/input/mice"
     Option      "ZAxisMapping"   "4 5"
     Option      "Buttons"        "5"
EndSection
