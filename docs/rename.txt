Rename USB Drive


Identify your Partition
=======================
Plug in your USB device and list your partitions with:
# fdisk -l

You can also list your mounted devices and their descriptions with:
# mount

or use parted:
# parted -l

--ubuntu.com

or use blkid:
# blkid


Using the Command line
======================
There are at least 6 separate command line tools used to label
a partition - the program used depends on the partition's
filesystem type:

1. For FAT16 and FAT32 partitions, use mlabel from the mtools package.
2. For NTFS partitions, use ntfslabel from the ntfs-3g package.
3. For ext2, ext3, or ext4 partitions, use e2label.
4. For JFS partitions, use jfs_tune.
5. For ReiserFS (v3) partitions, use reiserfstune.
6. For XFS partitions, use xfs_admin

Using the Partition Editor
==========================
The file manager (Nautilus) currently does not support renaming disk
partitions, but Gnome's Partition Editor (GParted) does.  To change a
partition's label, follow these directions.  (Be careful using Partition
Editor, as it's capable of making your computer completely unusable if you do
the wrong thing.)

1. Open the System > Administration menu and see if there's an entry for
   GParted (previously Partition Editor).

2. If there is, launch it.  If there isn't, install the "gparted" package
   and it should now appear in the menu. Enter your password when prompted.

3. Disk drives are divided up into partitions.  To find the partition you want
   to re-label, you first have to find the disk drive that contains it, using
   the drop-down menu in the upper right.  It will show a device name like
   /dev/sdb and the drive's total size in parentheses.  After selecting a
   drive, you will see a list of all partitions on that drive.

4. If the partition is mounted (has a key icon next to it), right-click on the
   partition and select Unmount.

5. With the key icon gone, right-click on the partition and select Label.
   If you can't select it, install the ntfsprogs package.

6. Enter the new partition name and press Ok.

7. The label change is now pending, but has not been completed.  Press the
   Apply button near the top of the window.  After confirming, it should say
   "All operations successfully completed".  The drive now has a new label.


Using the Command line
======================
There are at least 6 separate command line tools used to label a
partition - the program used depends on the partition's filesystem type:

1. For FAT16 and FAT32 partitions, use mlabel from the mtools package.

Check the current label
  # mlabel -i <device> -s ::
    example:
  # mlabel -i /dev/sdb1 -s ::

Change the label:
  After unmounting and checking the current label (above), use:
  # mlabel -i <device> ::<label>

    example:

  # mlabel -i /dev/sdb1 ::my_external

2. For NTFS partitions, use ntfslabel from the ntfs-3g package.

Check the current label:
  # ntfslabel <device>

    example:

 # ntfslabel /dev/sdb1

Change the label:
  Note: 128 characters maximum.

  # ntfslabel <device> <label>

    example:

  # ntfslabel /dev/sdb1 ntfs

3. For ext2, ext3, or ext4 partitions, use e2label.
Check the current label:
  e2label <device>
    example:
  e2label /dev/sdb1

Change the label:
  Note: 16 characters maximum.

  # e2label <device> <label>

    example:

  # e2label /dev/sdb2 ext4

4. For JFS partitions, use jfs_tune.
Check the current label
  # jfs_tune -l <device>

    example:

  # jfs_tune /dev/sdb1

Change the label:
  Note: 16 characters maximum.

  # jfs_tune -L <label> <device>

    example:

  # jfs_tune -L my_external /dev/sdb1

5. For ReiserFS (v3) partitions, use reiserfstune.
Change the label:
  Note: 16 characters maximum.

  # reiserfstune -l <label> <device>

    example:

  # reiserfstune -l my_external /dev/sdb1

6. For XFS partitions, use xfs_admin
Check the current label:
  # xfs_admin -l <device>

    example:

  # xfs_admin -l /dev/sdb1

Change the label:
  Note: 12 characters maximum.

  # xfs_admin -L <label> <device>

    example:

  # xfs_admin -l my_external /dev/sdb1

Verify the change
=================
Now for the easiest part: unplug the drive, wait a second, then plug it back
in.  It should appear on your desktop with the new label and have its new mount
point.

Without unplugging and having the device remount, you can also just run:

# blkid


Install Labeling Program
========================
# apt-get install mtools
# apt-get install ntfsprogs
# apt-get install e2fsprogs
# apt-get install jfsutils
# apt-get install reiserfsprogs
# apt-get install xfsprogs
