Partition USB 50/50 with ext4 and exFAT


parted is a program to manipulate disk partitions.  It supports multi‐
ple partition table formats, including MS-DOS and GPT.   It  is  useful
for  creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage,
and copying data to new hard disks.

  parted [options] [device [command [options...]...]]

  --parted 3.2, man

Syntax:
  parted mkpart part-type fs-type start end

  --wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Parted


Options
=======
mkpart part-type [fs-type] start end
       Make  a  part-type  partition  for filesystem fs-type (if
       specified), beginning at start  and  ending  at  end  (by
       default  in megabytes).  part-type should be one of "pri‐
       mary", "logical", or "extended".
       --parted 3.2, man

part-type is one of primary, extended or logical, and is meaningful
       only for MBR partition tables.
       --wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Parted

fs-type is an identifier chosen among those listed by entering help
       mkpart as the closest match to the file system that you will
       use. The mkpart command does not actually create the file
       system: the fs-type parameter will simply be used by parted
       to set a 1-byte code that is used by boot loaders to "preview"
       what kind of data is found in the partition, and act
       accordingly if necessary...

       Tip: Most Linux native file systems map to the same MBR partition
            type code (0x83), so it is perfectly safe to e.g. use ext2
            for an ext4-formatted partition.

       --wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Parted

p will print the output.  Without doing a separate print command.


Example
=======
Partitioning of 2x Sandisk Ultra 64GB SDDDC2-064G-G46
with 50% ext4 and 50% win32 for access by Debian stretch 9.4 amd64
and macBook Pro 2016.

What filesystem can macOS write?
  exFAT, NTFS, or Mac OS Extended (Journaled)
  --discussions.apple.com/thread/7141509

Commands:
  parted /dev/sdb print
  parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt
  parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ext2 0% 50% p
  parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ntfs 51% 100% p
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
  mkfs.exfat /dev/sdb2

1. List current partitions:
# parted /dev/sdb print
Model: SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 61.5GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start  End  Size  File system  Name  Flags
#

2. Make gpd partition table if not already:

# parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt
Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sdb will be destroyed and all data on
this disk will be lost. Do you want to continue?
Yes/No? Yes                                                               
Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

#

# parted /dev/sdb print                 
Model: SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 61.5GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start  End  Size  File system  Name  Flags

#


3. Create ext4 partion on 1st half of the usb key:


# parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ext2 0% 50% p
Model: SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 61.5GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      1049kB  30.8GB  30.8GB  ext2         primary

Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

Tip: Most Linux native file systems map to the same MBR partition
     type code (0x83), so it is perfectly safe to e.g. use ext2
     for an ext4-formatted partition.
     --wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Parted

NOTE: 0% is used instead of a concrete value such that parted
      will calculate the correct alignment not give an incorrect
      alignment error.
      --wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Parted


4. Create exFAT partion on 2nd half of the usb key:

# parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ntfs 51% 100% p
Model: SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 61.5GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      1049kB  30.8GB  30.8GB               primary
 2      31.4GB  61.5GB  30.1GB  ntfs         primary

Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

#

# parted /dev/sdb print
Model: SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 61.5GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      1049kB  30.8GB  30.8GB               primary
 2      31.4GB  61.5GB  30.1GB               primary  msftdata

#

	
Interesting how the file system names were lost
when the 2nd partition was formatted ntfs.


5. Format 1st parition ext4 and the 2nd partition exFAT
   using mkfs.ext4 and mkfs.exfat

# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
mke2fs 1.43.4 (31-Jan-2017)

 2      31.4GB  61.5GB  30.1GB               primary  msftdata

# 

Looks good.

6. Debian stretch amd64 is about to mount both the ext4
   and exFAT partions without issue:

# mount
...
/dev/sdb1 on /media/marcilr/19371776-9975-4bc5-886c-f2d77d92fe23 \
  type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,data=ordered,uhelper=udisks2)
/dev/sdb2 on /media/marcilr/8930-667E type fuseblk \
  (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096,uhelper=udisks2)
#


"fuseblk" is just how an ntfs partition is reported via the "mount" command,
among others. The "fuse" part comes from FUSE (file system in userspace).

Here is a link to the wiki on FUSE, but it probably won't give you a great
deal of understanding of how FUSE works.

Best Disk Format for using both Windows and OS
Unless you're willing to get additional software,

Create and format exFAT partition from Linux
  To format a partition, use mkexfatfs / mkfs.exfat like with most
  filesystems, e.g.:

  mkfs.exfat /dev/sdX1

  As for creating the partition in the first place, this is the same
  as for any other filesystem.  Create a partition in your favourite 
  partition manager.  If you have a MBR partition type, set its type
  to NTFS (that is code 7).

exFAT
exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution
(due to data structure overhead), yet the file size limit of the standard
FAT32 file system (i.e. 4 GiB) remains in those scenarios.  exFAT has been
adopted by the SD Card Association as the default file system for SDXC
cards larger than 32 GiB.
