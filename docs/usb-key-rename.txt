USB Key Rename


Get list of drives connected to computer:

# blkid
/dev/sda5: UUID="a400441f-2413-4295-9c7c-4398e7584362" TYPE="swap" 
/dev/sda1: UUID="62a4de0b-59da-4f49-9a23-b8c5bf1b05b6" TYPE="ext3" SEC_TYPE="ext2" 
/dev/sdb: SEC_TYPE="msdos" LABEL="Debian Inst" UUID="DEB0-0001" TYPE="vfat
#

NOTE: /dev/sdb is the usb key.

Force unmount
=============
Use:

# umount -l /media/<usb device>

Example:
# umount -l /media/Debian\ Inst/


FAT32
=====
Since the 80s, portable media like floppy disks have used FAT.  To date it is
probably the most common file system type and is support by almost all
operating systems.  Therefore if you own a USB device, it's probably using FAT
and you can change the device label (name) with the following command:

mlabel -i /dev/sdb1 ::Camera

Usually mlabel requires you to specify a DOS style drive letter, like :C or :F
but here we're using a special device :: which allows us to specify a UNIX
style device name.  Replace Camera with your own device name. :!: If you get
an error like "Total number of sectors (7831520) not a multiple of sectors per
track (63)!" then add a line of code to your mtools configuration file using
the following command:

sinisterstuf.org/

mtools - Tools for manipulating MSDOS files


NTFS
====
This is a Windows filesystem and is usually used for the hard disk drive in
your computer or on large USB devices where you expect to store files bigger
than 4GB, a size limitation in FAT.  You can rename these kinds of drives
using:

ntfslabel /dev/sdb1 movie_drive

sinisterstuf.org/


EXT
===
The first filesystem created specifically for Linux, EXT is a fast journalling
filesystem used by most distributions of GNU/Linux.  Rename these kinds of
filesystems like this:

e2label /dev/sdb1 live-usb
echo mtools_skip_check=1 >> ~/.mtoolsrc

sinisterstuf.org/


Use e2label, like this: e2label device newlabel
