Using UUID


Linux prefers to use UUID (Universally Unique Identifier),
LABEL, or symlinks to identify media storage devices on a
system. Using device assignments (like /dev/hd*# or /dev/sd*#)
is not preferred since these can change between system boots:

1. all filesystems should be specified by UUID=<id> or
   LABEL=<name> for each partition.

2. all physical devices should be specified by a symlink, like
/dev/cdrom for a cd drive and /dev/disk/by-id/... for each
physical hard drive.

The files for which UUID is most critical:

1. /boot/grub/menu.lst

2. /etc/fstab

3. /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume

Using LABEL
===========
Labels can be very useful for external media, like flash
drives and USB hard drives since these are generally
automounted by hal (Hardware Abstraction Layer).  If a
device has a label, it will be mounted at the /media/<label>
location and appear with the label on the desktop.
